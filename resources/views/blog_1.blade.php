    <h2 class="margin-top-30 color-blue">What is cold canvassing?</h2>
    <p class="margin-top-30 text-justify">Cold canvassing is the practice of contacting people and gauging their interest in later purchasing the service or merchandise. There is no sales pitch or even specifics on what you are selling in this conversation. The primary purpose of the encounter is to survey the person and gather information that will aid in the identification of leads.</p>
    <h3 class="margin-top-30">Cold canvassing can be performed in two ways:</h3>
    <p class="margin-top-30 text-justify"><b>1. </b> You will do this in person by going door to door in a neighbourhood.<br>
        <b>2. </b> On the phone: If you have a small team, you can arrange a phonathon to communicate with a huge number of individuals, or you can go through lists separately.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">Let's look at an example of cold canvassing and see how this works. Assume there is a soap manufacturing business. A direct sales pitch would include discussing the product's USP and why someone should buy it.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">If the organization was cold canvassing, though, the dialog would most certainly involve issues like:</p>

            <p class="text-justify">The first and second questions disclose the prospect's interests, enabling the company to determine whether or not the prospect is interested in their soap.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">The third question shows a person's brand loyalty, and if the answer is no, the organization will know that this possibility isn't a high priority.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">You should send this detail to the sales staff so they can follow up with people who are involved in the product and pitch it to them.</p>
            <h3 class="margin-top-30">Benefits of cold canvassing</h3>
            <p>If you're on the fence about whether or not cold canvassing is ideal for you, consider the following three advantages.</p>
            <p class="margin-top-30 text-justify"><b>1. Reduces cold calling anxiety</b><br>
                Since there is a chance of confrontation if the individual is not involved, salespeople sometimes feel some apprehension before cold calling. Keep in mindthat we're talking about cold calling, which is the move after cold canvassing where you contact cold prospects.<br>
                When you know the person is involved in the product or service you're selling, cold canvassing will make you relax. In such situations, the contact is a little lesssevere and callers are conscious that they will not be exposed to any lashes.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-top-30 text-justify"><b>2. Higher conversion rates</b><br>
                It's self-evident. Since you're just engaging with people who are involved in the product, your conversion rate would be very high.<br>
                Cold calling (calling someone on the prospect list) is only effective 2 percent of the time, when eligible leads convert 20% of the time.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-top-30 text-justify"><b>3. Provides valuable insights into the consumer</b><br>
                Cold canvassing will provide you with a lot of data on your target client in addition to improving your sales rates by screening out uninterested prospects.<br>
                This insight will be used to enhance your product or service to make it more attractive to your target market. Take, for example, the soap maker we listed earlier. If they find that a majority of people like their soaps to lather more when canvassing, they may adjust their soap or their marketing campaign to emphasize this point, making it more attractive to a wider market.<br>
                These advantages add up to an increase in net revenue by making the distribution process more effective.

    <h2 class="margin-top-30 color-blue">How to implement cold canvassing?</h2>
    <p class="margin-top-30 text-justify">Are you convinced that cold canvassing is an essential component of your sales strategy? You need to be. So, let's go over the precautions you'll need to take to conduct canvassing.</p>
    <p class="margin-top-30"><b>1. Decide your target prospects.</b></p>
    <p class="text-justify">The first question you must answer before you begin canvassing is who you will target. This would depend on the product you're offering. Consider the following scenario:</p>
    <div class="row margin-top-30">
        <div class="col-lg-1 col-md-1 col-sm-2 col-xs-2 sm-margin-left text-center div-padding-right">

    <p class="text-justify"> This can also be viewed as a form of prospect prequalification. You'll have a clearer sense of what information you need from them if you know who to target.</p>

    <p class="text-justify">Choosing the interaction's goal will help you frame your survey questions.</p>
