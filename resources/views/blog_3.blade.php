    <P class="text-justify margin-top-30 ">It's important to consider the dangers that come with making phone calls to locate customers if you're a real estate agent. Prospecting over the phone carries certain risks, but if you train yourself, you will greatly reduce the chance.</P>

    <h2 class="margin-top-30 dark-color-blue">Five Concepts Every Agent Should Know</h2>
    <P class="text-justify margin-top-30 "><b>1. Why Is There A Risk?
            <span class="display-block">2. What Does This Mean For You?</span>
            <span class="display-block">3. Reducing The Risk</span>
            <span class="display-block">4. Compliance Is Up To You</span>
            <span class="display-block">5. The Big Picture</span></b></P>

    <h2 class="margin-top-30 dark-color-blue">Why Is There A Risk?</h2>
    <P class="text-justify margin-top-30 ">In 1991, the number of unsolicited telemarketing calls received by consumersincreased, particularly from robo-dialers and pre-recorded calling machines.</P>
    <P class="text-justify">The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) was passed in reaction to an uptick in unsolicited calls, and it places restrictions on sales calls, robo-dialers, and videos. The TCPA also gives birth to the Do-Not-Call (DNC) Registry, which allows people to opt out of receiving telemarketing calls.</P>
    <P class="text-justify">The DNC Registry, which is run by the Federal Trade Commission, allows customers to limit unsolicited sales calls by making telemarketers' violations of the law punishable by large fines.</P>

    <h2 class="margin-top-30 dark-color-blue">What Does This Mean For Real Estate Agents?</h2>
    <P class="text-justify margin-top-30 ">As a salesperson, you must comply with all DNC Registry laws. “Realtors® cannot contact customers who are on the Do-Not-Call Registry to entice themto purchase or sell a house or property,” according to the National Association of Realtors® (NAR).</P>
    <P class="text-justify">If a phone number is on the DNC list, you have an 18-month withdrawal period from the date of buying, sale, or lease, according to the rules. The 18-month cycle begins when the buyer and seller make their final deposit or sale. To make service deals outside of this time limit, you'll need written permission.</P>
    <P class="text-justify">Overall, anyone who contacts a DNC Registry phone number to provide services is subject to the DNC Registry's rules and guidelines (and the penalties for violating them).</P>

    <h2 class="margin-top-30 dark-color-blue">Reducing The Risks</h2>
    <P class="text-justify margin-top-30 ">You should look up any number on the National DNC Registry (and your state's list) and actually opt not to dial such numbers to minimize the chance of litigation as a result of concerns from homeowners and tenants.</P>
    <P class="text-justify">Platforms like Vortex are used by professional prospectors to scrape telephone numbers against the DNC registry. Platforms like this make it simple to adhere to the DNC list and reach out to homeowners who are interested in discussing the purchase or sale of their house.</P>
    <P class="text-justify">Choose a prospecting platform that helps you to upload your list of phone numbers and addresses so you can quickly double-check them against the DNC list. Both numbers listed on the DNC register would be clearly marked ona decent forum. You can effectively remove people from your call sessions if you don't have a business arrangement with them.</P>
    <P class="text-justify">You should relax, though, whether you have a pre-existing agreement or written approval from DNC registrants. The DNC rules and instructions do not prohibit calling these numbers. Calls to numbers on the DNC list, aside from these two exceptions, vastly increase the chance.</P>

    <h2 class="margin-top-30 dark-color-blue">Compliance Is Up To You</h2>
    <P class="text-justify margin-top-30 ">If the source of your leads (title providers or lead services) pulls data from public sources to supply you with contact numbers, so you are responsible forfollowing the DNC rules and regulations.</P>
    <P class="text-justify">Before you begin prospecting, reputable lead providers will issue you with warnings. This alert is intended for real estate brokers who are unaware of the threats or unable to accept them. Agents are reminded to be obedient by in-app alerts like this:</P>

    <h2 class="margin-top-30 dark-color-blue">The Big Picture</h2>
    <P class="text-justify margin-top-30 ">There are threats and benefits, as in most company strategies. It's up to you to figure out how to strike a balance between the two. Compliance is requiredof real estate agents. It's possible that your MLS and broker have their own rules for calling. Educate yourself before calling, make good calls, and dial carefully.</P>
